[{"content":"I am an NSF Graduate Research Fellow and a DDF Fellow at the University of Minnesota.\nPreviously, I completed Part III of the Mathematical Tripos at the University of Cambridge during 2016-2017.\nBefore starting my Ph.D, I was a vistor at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in the Afshordi group from 2017-2018.\nI am interested in theoretical aspects of gravity; particularly on understanding the classical, semiclassical, and quantum properties of black holes. Some of my projects are highlighted below.\nMy publications can be found here. For more information, please see my CV.\nQuantum Gravity $\\textit{\\\u0026}\\ $ Holography I have a long history of being involved in studying aspects of quantum gravity via holography. Holography, also referred to as AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_{d}$ or as the gauge/gravity duality, is a collection of ideas which form a toolkit. The toolkit allows one to convert difficult problems in a type of quantum field theory, known as conformal field theory (CFT$_{d}$), into simpler problems encountered by gravity theories with a negative cosmological constant, called anti de Sitter gravity (AdS$_{d+1}$). One condition to use the toolkit is that the conformal field theory operates in $d$-dimensions whereas the gravity theory lives in one dimension higher, i.e., $d+1$-dimensions. Earlier in my academic career, I used gravity to model aspects of nuclear physics and the theory of strong interactions, QCD -- which behaves like a CFT$_d$ at high energies. Recently, I have turned my attention to using CFT$_d$ to answer problems in gravity through the holographic toolkit. Along this line, my current research interests are entanglement entropy, lower dimensional gravity, and black hole information. Deforming CFT$_d$ and the Hawking-Page Transition\nIn my most recent paper on holography, my collaborator and I established a new result on the Hawking-Page transition in AdS$_{d+1}$ gravity and its relationship to the deconfinement/confinement phase transition found in certain CFT$_{d}$. Like the phase transition where ice melts into water at high temperatures, composite particles, such as protons and neutrons, also melt at high temperatures into a quark-gluon plasma. When a phase transition occurs in the CFT$_d$ side, holography tells us that a black hole is expected to spontaneously form from a collapse of thermal gas in the AdS$_{d+1}$ side. The spontaneous formation of black holes at a critical temperature $\\beta$ is known as the Hawking-Page transition. In an earlier paper by Edward Witten , it was observed that the deconfinement/confinement phase transition can be avoided by deforming the CFT$_d$ side. In such cases, it was conjectured that black hole formation is prohibited in such cases. We asked a simple question; Is this conjecture true, and if so, when this phase transition is avoided, is the formation of black holes suppressed abruptly or continuously? This is a sharp quantum gravity question we can answer via the holographic duality. Our construction uses a parameter $\\theta$ which controls the phase transition. The results are highlighted in the right figure. We found that the phase transition (the filled regions) is avoided at $\\theta=\\pi/3,\\pi,5\\pi/3$ whereas the black hole formation (the hatched region) is prevented whenever $\\theta\\in[\\pi/3,5\\pi/3]$. The result is surprising for several reasons. We expected black hole formation to be suppressed abruptly but it appears that black holes can still form for a small window! Secondly, there are mismatchs - there are missing islands and the temperatures $\\beta$ do not precisely match up at $\\theta=0$. It is always exciting to encounter such mismatches as they inspire deeper questions about the nature of gravity in holography that I am currently investigating! Uniform Black String Instabilities in Anti de Sitter In 2021, my collaborator and I showed that uniform black strings in AdS (AdS UBS) suffer from the Gregory-Laflamme instability; an instability which causes black string objects to develop a pinch in their horizons (shown in the left cartoon). At the end state of the instability, a singularity is expected to appear and the black string fragments into two black holes. It was previously suspected that the AdS UBS could avoid the instability. However, we performed a numerical search for the instability and found a parameter regime where the instability can occur (shown in the below images in $d=5,\\dots,9$ on the left and $d=10$ on the right). If the conditions are just right, a black string will fragment into several smaller black holes at the end state of the GL instability. The transition between uniform black strings and black holes (BH) are interesting as a naked singularity is formed in finite time. However, if certain conditions are not met, the BS will instead converge onto different geometry without a naked singularity forming. In this paper, we argued that the AdS UBS could either fragment into a BH or converge onto a black funnel geometry (BF). We found conditions where the fragmentation is more likely (i.e., entropically favorable) rather transitioning smoothly to a BF state. ","date":"27 April 2022","permalink":"/about/","section":"Hi!

When I came across Ben Moseley\u0026rsquo;s post on Physics Informed Neural Networks, I instantly knew what I was going to be doing this afternoon \u0026ndash; I wanted to implement neural networks using Mathematica to solve a simple problem, the Harmonic Oscillator. As Sidney Coleman once said,\n \u0026ldquo;The career of a young theoretical physicist consists of treating the harmonic oscillator in ever-increasing levels of abstraction,\u0026rdquo;\n and applying sufficiently well trained neural network to a canonical problem in physics is well within the limits of abstraction.\nTheory # The canonical problem of the harmonic oscillator is to understand a system with a restoring force \\(F(\\chi)=-k\\chi.\\) For a single restoring force acting on masses connected to springs, or pendulums freely moving in a gravitational field, the system undergoes simple harmonic motion induced by the restoring force. Mathematically, the objective is to solve the system:\n$$ \\begin{equation*}m\\frac{d^2\\chi(t)}{dt^2} + k\\chi(t)=0\\end{equation*} $$\nsubject to some initial data \\((\\chi(0)=\\xi,\\chi\u0026rsquo;(0)=\\zeta)\\). Of course, any budding physicist knows there is an exact solution\n$$\\begin{equation*}\\chi(t) = \\frac{\\zeta}{\\omega}\\sin(\\omega t) + \\xi\\cos(\\omega t)\\end{equation*}$$\nwhich has a straightforward wave-like behavior plotted below for a representative set of solutions.\n   Applications # Now, we turn to the problem of constructing neural networks with Mathematica architecture in order to learn harmonic motion directly. We will train the network for the parameters and the domain\n$$\\begin{equation*}[\\xi=1,\\zeta=0,\\omega=3;\\ t_{\\rm sample}\\in(0,\\pi)]\\end{equation*}$$\nMathematica\u0026rsquo;s neural network algorithms can produce a trained fit to the initial sample. Here, I show how I did it but more documentation can be found in this post.\nThe algorithm is as follows. First, construct the solution with the parameters above. I created a function Sols which solves the differential equation for harmonic motion provided data $(\\xi,\\zeta,\\omega)$. For this particular example, I created an instance\nOscillator[t_]:=Evaluate[Sols[t,1,0,3]];Next, gather some training data. I chose about 30 points to train the neural network (NN).\ndata=Simplify[Table[t-\u0026gt;Oscillator[t],{t,0,\\[Pi],\\[Pi]/30}]//N];   Now, construct a neural network with NetChain. I chose a NN with 5 hidden layers, and 1 input/output layer respectively. The model uses different types of ElementwiseLayer, such as IntegerParts, Tanh, and LogisticSigmoid, to train the network. I found that this was best for convergence.\nnet=NetChain[{150,Tanh,150,LogisticSigmoid,1}]The five entries provided in NetChain define functions only on the hidden layer. Finally, we can train the model with NetTrain.\ntrainingdata=NetTrain[net,data,All,TimeGoal-\u0026gt;30]Essentially, this takes the NN and trains it on the sample data in around 30 seconds. The NN converged rather quickly to a loss of about $3.67\\times 10^{-5}$.\nAnd we\u0026rsquo;re done! Let\u0026rsquo;s visualize the trained data now, the results are shown in the plot below.\n   Although the neural networks performs a good fit when trained, it has not learned any physics in any meaningful way. So for now, it seems a young theoretical physicist can still beat a well trained neural network. But this result brings up a natural question, can we do better using Mathematica architecture?\n It turns out the answer is no, see here for a more extensive discussion.\n The goal of Part II is to reproduce Ben\u0026rsquo;s calculation in Physics-Informed Neural Networks by writing better neural networks which incorporates a regularization scheme where the equation of motion is simultaneously minimized along with a cost function.\n","date":"20 April 2022","permalink":"/posts/2022-04-20-physical-neural-networks---the-harmonic-oscillator/","section":"Posts","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been really interested in machine learning and neural networks in the context of physics recently.","title":"Physical Neural Networks - The Harmonic Oscillator, Part I"},{"content":"   document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function() { renderMathInElement(document.body, { // customised options // ‚Ä¢ auto-render specific keys, e.g.: delimiters: [ {left: '$$', right: '$$', display: true}, {left: '$', right: '$', display: false}, {left: '\\\\(', right: '\\\\)', display: false}, {left: '\\\\[', right: '\\\\]', display: true} ], // ‚Ä¢ rendering keys, e.g.: throwOnError : false }); });  -- The entanglement entropy is a measure of how quantum information is stored in a quantum state. In particular, the entanglement entropy measures the amount of entanglement between two subsystems of a composite quantum system. Here, I will review the entanglement entropy and then compute it for a simple example \u0026ndash; the two spin system both analytically and with the QuantumFramework Packlet on Mathematica 13. I will largely be following Nishioka 2018, Hong Liu\u0026rsquo;s HEE MIT lecture, and Tom Hartman\u0026rsquo;s excellent notes.\nTheory # The canonical example is to consider a system which is subdivided into two regions $A$ and $B$, see figure below taken from Nishioka 2018.\n   The system $\\Sigma$ is said to be bipartite if its Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_ \\Sigma$ can be expressed by the tensor product $$ \\mathcal{H}_ \\Sigma = \\mathcal{H}_ I\\otimes\\mathcal{H}_ {I^c} $$ over the individual subsystems where $I=A$ or $B$. To see if the two subsystems are entangled, we need further technologies: a density matrix $\\rho_ \\Sigma$ and an operation $\\text{Tr}_ I$ which isolates a subsystem. The first is easy, the density matrix, by definition, is constructed from the (pure) quantum state $\\ket{\\Psi}\\in\\mathcal{H}_ \\Sigma$ of the system\n$$\\begin{equation*}\\rho_ \\Sigma = \\ket{\\Psi}\\bra{\\Psi}.\\end{equation*}$$\nFor the second, let ${\\ket{i}_ I, i=1,2,\\cdots, \\dim(\\mathcal{H}_ I)}$ be an orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}_ I$. The partial trace $ \\text{Tr}_ {I}$ of an operator $\\mathcal{O}$ is then defined by\n$$\\begin{equation*}\\text{Tr}_ I(\\mathcal{O}) \\equiv \\sum_ {i} {}_ {I}\\bra{i}\\mathcal{O}\\ket{i}_ {I}.\\end{equation*}$$\nThe partial trace can be used to isolate a subsystem $I$ by \u0026ldquo;tracing out\u0026rdquo; the complement $I^c$. To be concrete, the reduced density matrix of the subsystem $I$ is obtained via\n$$\\begin{equation*}\\rho_ {I} \\equiv \\text{Tr}_ {I^c}(\\rho_ \\Sigma).\\end{equation*}$$\nWe now have the necessary ingredients to compute the von Neumann entropy stored in the entanglement between $I$ and $I^c$. The entanglement entropy of the subsystem $I$ is computed by the formula\n$$\\begin{equation*}S_ I = - \\text{Tr}_ {I}[\\rho_ {I}\\log(\\rho_ {I})].\\end{equation*}$$\nThis entropy satisfies the following statements:\n  The entanglement entropy is non-zero only if the complement of the subsystem is non-empty. In other words, $S_ I=0$ when $\\text{Area}(I^c)=0$. To see this, first note that $\\text{Area}(I^c)=0$ is the same as saying $I^c=\\emptyset$. Next, we have $\\Sigma = I \\cup I^c = I \\cup \\emptyset = I$. And finally, it is well known that the entanglement entropy of the total system always vanishes for a pure state. Proof: $$\\begin{align*}S_ I \u0026amp;= - \\text{Tr}_ {I}[\\rho_ {I}\\log(\\rho_ {I})] = - \\text{Tr}_ {\\Sigma}[\\rho_ \\Sigma\\log(\\rho_ \\Sigma)] = - \\text{Tr}_ {\\Sigma}[ODO^{-1}\\log(ODO^{-1})]\\newline\u0026amp;=-\\text{Tr}_ {\\Sigma}[D\\log(D)]=0\\end{align*}$$ where we have used that the density matrix (i) can be diagonalized, i.e., $$\\rho_{\\Sigma}=ODO^{-1}$$ and (ii) the ground state is pure so $$\\rho_\\Sigma = (\\rho_\\Sigma)^2$$ implying that the eigenvalues $\\lambda_i\\in{0,1}.$\n  The entanglement entropy is finite for finite-dimensional quantum systems, such as on a lattice. However, $S_I$ suffers from UV divergences in quantum field theory (necessarily infinite dimensional) due to short range interactions near the boundary of $I$, denoted $\\partial I$.\n  It is possible to show that the entanglement entropy vanishes only if the pure ground state is separable which means that the quantum state admits the decomposition $\\ket{\\Psi} = \\ket{\\Psi}_ I\\otimes\\ket{\\Psi}_ {I^c}$. In the case where $\\text{Area}(I^c)=0$, there exists no states in $\\mathcal{H}_ {I^c}$ and hence the bipartition is simple $\\ket{\\Psi}=\\ket{\\Psi}_ I\\otimes 1 = \\ket{\\Psi}_ \\Sigma$.\n  Applications # This is all well and good in theory, but how does one actually go about computing the entanglement entropy given a state?\nThe simplest example is the two spin system (see Fig. 1(a)). Let $A$ and $B$ be two particles with spin $s=1/2$. Each particle has two states in their respective Hilbert spaces $$H_ {I}=\\text{span}({\\ket{\\uparrow}_ I,\\ket{\\downarrow}_ I})$$ where $I=A$ or $B$ and the bases are orthonormal $\\braket{i}{j}=\\delta_{ij}$ for $i,j\\in{\\uparrow,\\downarrow}$. The total Hilbert space is then straightforward to build $$\\mathcal{H}_ \\Sigma =\\mathcal{H}_ I\\otimes\\mathcal{H}_ {I^c}= {\\ket{\\downarrow\\downarrow},\\ket{\\downarrow\\uparrow},\\ket{\\uparrow\\downarrow},\\ket{\\uparrow\\uparrow}}$$ where $\\ket{ij}\\equiv\\ket{i}_ I\\otimes\\ket{j}_ {I^c}$.\nNow, suppose the ground state is given as\n$$\\begin{equation*}\\ket{\\Psi} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{\\downarrow\\uparrow}+\\ket{\\uparrow\\downarrow})\\end{equation*}$$\nthen the density matrix of the total system reads\n$$\\begin{equation*}\\rho_\\Sigma=\\ket{\\Psi}\\bra{\\Psi}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\ket{\\downarrow\\uparrow}+\\ket{\\uparrow\\downarrow})^2.\\end{equation*}$$\nTracing out, say $I^c=B$, we arrive at the reduced density matrix for $I=A$\n$$\\begin{align*}\\rho_A = \\frac{1}{2}(\\ket{\\downarrow}_A{}_A\\bra{\\downarrow}+\\ket{\\uparrow}_A{}_A\\bra{\\uparrow}) = \\begin{pmatrix}1/2 \u0026amp; 0\\newline0 \u0026amp;1/2\\end{pmatrix} \\end{align*}$$\nAnd now a straightforward calculation of the entanglement entropy $S_A$ shows\n$$\\begin{align*}S_{A} \u0026amp;= -\\text{Tr}_A\\left[\\begin{pmatrix}1/2 \u0026amp; 0\\newline0 \u0026amp;1/2\\end{pmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{pmatrix}\\log(1/2) \u0026amp; 0\\newline0 \u0026amp;\\log(1/2)\\end{pmatrix}\\right]\\newline\u0026amp;=\\log(2)\\end{align*}$$\nThis seemingly innocous value is in fact the maximum amount of von Neumann entropy (or more loosely information) stored between two entangled particles! To prove this statement, let us consider a more general state\n$$\\ket{\\Psi} = \\cos(\\theta)\\ket{\\downarrow\\uparrow}-\\sin(\\theta)\\ket{\\uparrow\\downarrow}$$\nand study this problem in Mathematica 13.\nEntanglement Entropy on Mathematica 13 # Recently, the Quantum Information Research Team at Wolfram Alpha have developed frameworks which greatly simplify the calculations required to compute the entanglement entropy (in low dimensional examples). This code can be found on my Github.\nThe code snippet below demonstrates how the QuantumFramework packlet can be used to reproduce the entanglement entropy of the Bell state.\n   Now to study the generalized Bell state, we essentially reproduce the code but have to change the initial state:\n   Hence, the entanglement entropy stored in the generalized entangled states is\n$$S_A(\\theta) = -2\\left[\\cos(\\theta)^2\\log(\\cos(\\theta))+\\sin(\\theta)^2\\log(\\sin(\\theta)) \\right]$$\nNow, we are ready to maximize $S_A(\\theta)$ and prove that $S_A=\\log(2)$ is the maximum amount of entropy which can be stored in two-spin system. This amounts to finding $\\theta_c$ such that $$\\frac{d}{d\\theta}S_A(\\theta)\\rvert_{\\theta_c}=0.$$ A quick calculation shows\n$$\\theta_c = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\implies S_{A}(\\theta_c) = \\log(2).$$\nIt is also immediate to show this on Mathematica:\n    The purpose of this post was to discuss some basic facts about the entropy of entanglement and study a simple example both analyticially and numerically. In the next post, we study the case of the Thermofield double state as we slowly build towards the holographic entanglement entropy.\nAcknowledgments # I appreciate √Ö.

This integral, denoted by $\\mathcal{Z}$, is defined as follows\n$$\\begin{equation}\\mathcal{Z} = A \\int[\\mathcal{D}g] e^{-\\mathcal{I}[g]}.\\end{equation}$$\nThis is a functional integral with a normalization A, measure $\\mathcal{D}[g]$, and integrand $e^{-\\mathcal{I}[g]}$ of metrics $g$ with Euclidean signature. (A primer on functional integration will be released shortly.) Essentially, computing the path integral for any system, subject to certain conditions discussed below, allows one to completely characterize the thermodynamics of the system. In practice, the above path integral is impossible to evaluate directly except in special cases. Rather than evaluating $\\mathcal{Z}$ exactly, there are several techniques to approximate its value. One such technique is the saddle point approximation. The idea is that when the action $\\mathcal{I}[g]\\gg1$, the integrand $e^{\\mathcal{I}[g]}\\ll1$. Hence, the most dominant contributions are given by the minima of the function where we can approximate\n$$\\mathcal{I}[g] = \\sum_i\\mathcal{I}[g_ i] + \\frac{1}{2}(g-g_ i)^2\\frac{\\delta^2}{\\delta g^2}\\mathcal{I}[g]|_ {g=g_i}+\\dots$$\nThen the path integral simply reduces to a Gaussian integral which can be normalized as follows\n$$\\begin{equation}\\mathcal{Z} \\approx A e^{-\\sum_{i}\\mathcal{I}[g_ i]} \\int[\\mathcal{D}g]e^{\\sum_ i \\frac{1}{2}(g-g_ i)^2\\frac{\\delta^2}{\\delta g^2}\\mathcal{I}[g]|_ {g=g_ i}+\\dots} = e^{-\\sum_{i}\\mathcal{I}[g_i]}.\\end{equation}$$\nThus the entire contribution of the geometry to the Euclidean path integral is encoded in the minima of the action functional.\nIn order to make contact with thermodynamics, we invoke the following equivalence: the action in Euclidean signature is proportional to the free energy of the system with the proportionality set by the inverse temperature, i.e., $\\mathcal{I}[g] = \\beta F = (1/T)F$.\nTo be concrete, I detail the thermodynamics for Euclidean gravity with a negative cosmological constant, or Einstein-AdS gravity. This theory of gravity admits two minima: a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole, and a thermal gas of photons in AdS spacetime. These two minima admit phase transitions at a critical tempeture which will be studied in a later article.\nGravitational Saddle Points in AdS$_d$ # We will review the purely gravitational saddle points allowed in AdS$_ {d+2}$ space and describe the Hawking-Page phase transition between a thermal AdS background and an SAdS$_ {d+2}$ black hole. Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be a Lorentzian manifold and $\\partial\\mathcal{M}$ a codimension one boundary. We consider the theory\n$$\\begin{equation} \\mathcal{I} = -\\frac{1}{8\\pi G_ {d+2}} \\times\\left[\\mathcal{S}_ {\\mathcal{X}}+\\mathcal{S}_ {\\partial\\mathcal{X}}\\right]\\end{equation}$$\nwhere the bulk and the boundary actions are respectively\n$$\\begin{align} \\mathcal{S}_ \\mathcal{X} =\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{2}\\int_ \\mathcal{X}\\text{d}^{d+2}x\\sqrt{-g} \\left[R - 2\\Lambda\\right],\\newline \\mathcal{S}_ {\\partial\\mathcal{X}} =\u0026amp; \\int_{\\partial\\mathcal{X}}\\text{d}^{d+1}x\\sqrt{-h}\\left[\\mathcal{K}+\\frac{d+1}{\\ell^2} + c_1(d) \\mathcal{R} \\right.\\newline \u0026amp;+\\left.c_2(d)\\left(\\mathcal{R}_ {ab}\\mathcal{R}^{ab} - c_3(d)\\mathcal{R}^2\\right) +\\cdots \\right]\\nonumber. \\end{align}$$\nThe boundary action is necessary for a well-posed variational principle and to regularize the bulk action. Here $\\Lambda = -d(d+1)/2\\ell^2$, $R(g)$ is the scalar curvature, and $\\mathcal{K}$ and $\\mathcal{R}$ are the extrinsic and scalar curvatures of the boundary metric $h$ respectively. Note that higher curvature corrections to the boundary action appear in $d\\ge 6$ and the coefficients $c_i(d)$ are sensitive to the dimension and the topology of the horizon. The equations of motion and the trace of the Einstein equations read\n$$\\begin{align*} R_{ab} - \\frac{1}{2}g_{ab}R + \\Lambda g_{ab} \u0026amp;= 0\\newline \\frac{d}{2}R + (d+2)\\Lambda \u0026amp;=0 \\end{align*}$$\nfrom which the on-shell bulk action then simplifies considerably to a single volume integral\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\mathcal{S}_ {\\mathcal{X}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{\\mathcal{X}}\\text{d}^{d+2}x\\sqrt{-g}\\left(\\frac{4\\Lambda}{d}\\right)= \\frac{2\\Lambda}{d} \\text{Vol}(\\mathcal{X}). \\end{equation}$$\nHence, the entire contribution of the bulk action, $\\mathcal{I}$, to the thermodynamics is only dependent on the topological nature of the transverse directions to the horizon. Clearly, the bulk action is divergent since we are integrating over the entire space. The boundary action $\\mathcal{S}_ {\\partial\\mathcal{X}}$ regulates this divergence rendering $\\mathcal{I}$ finite.\nBlack Hole Saddles # Let us apply this procedure to saddle points of the above action. First, we have to identify geometries which are regular after Wick rotation $\\tau = i t$ to Euclidean space. The general solution, in static coordinates, is given by\n$$\\begin{align} \\text{d} s^{2}\u0026amp;=-f(r)\\text{d} t^{2}+\\frac{\\text{d} r^{2}}{f(r)}+\\frac{r^{2}}{\\ell^2}\\text{d}\\Sigma_{d,k}^{2} \\newline f(r)\u0026amp;=k-\\frac{m}{r^{(d-1)}}+\\frac{r^{2}}{\\ell ^{2}}. \\end{align}$$\nThere are two relevant saddles; the Schwarzschild-AdS$_ {d+2}$ solution, $m \u0026gt; 0$, and the pure AdS$_ {d+2}$, $m=0$, solution. Here, the $d$-dimensional metric $\\text{d}\\Sigma_{d,k}$ corresponds to the various boundary geometries which respect the isometries of AdS$_ {d+2}$ spacetime. In particular,\n$$\\begin{equation} \\text{d}\\Sigma_{d,k}^2 = \\begin{cases} \\ell^2\\text{d}\\Omega_d^2 \u0026amp;\\text{for}\\hspace{.1in} k=1,\\newline \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^d\\text{d} x_i^2 \u0026amp;\\text{for}\\hspace{.1in} k=0,\\newline \\ell^2\\text{d}\\Xi_d^2 \u0026amp;\\text{for}\\hspace{.1in} k=-1, \\end{cases} \\end{equation}$$\nwhere $\\text{d}\\Omega_d^2$ and $\\text{d}\\Xi_d^2$ are the unit metrics on $S^d$ and $H^d$. Thus $k=+1,0,-1$ represents spherical, planar, and hyperbolic boundaries respectively. We denote the outer horizon by $r_+$ which is located at the largest positive root of $f(r_+)=0$.\nBlack Hole Thermodynamics # To compute the thermodynamics, we perform an analytic continuation of time into the Euclidean section. In order to avoid a conical singularity, we must have $$\\tau \\sim \\tau + {4\\pi}/{f\u0026rsquo;(r_+)}.$$ The temperature may be computed via the standard Euclidean trick\n$$\\begin{align} T(r_+)\u0026amp;=\\frac{f^\\prime(r_+)}{4\\pi}=\\frac{(d-1)k}{4 \\pi r_+} +\\frac{(d+1) r_+}{4 \\pi \\ell ^2} \\end{align}$$\nThe remaining thermodynamic quantities are\n$$\\begin{align} \\mathcal{I}^* \u0026amp;= \\beta \\frac{\\sigma_{d,k}}{16\\pi G_{d+2}} \\left[r^{d-1}\\left(k - \\frac{r^{2}}{\\ell^2}\\right)\\right] - \\mathcal{I}_ {k}^0, \\newline E \u0026amp;= \\partial_\\beta{\\mathcal{I}} = \\frac{d,\\sigma_{d,k}}{16\\pi G_{d+2}}m - E_{k}^0,\\newline S \u0026amp;= \\frac{A(\\mathcal{H})}{4G_{d+2}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{d}r^{d}_ +}{4G_{d+2}} \\end{align}$$\nHence, the parameter $m$ appearing in the metric function is related to the ADM mass of the black hole. Here, $\\sigma_d$ is the volume of the unit $d$-dimensional boundary. Note that we may solve for $r_+(T)$ from $T(r_+)$.\nFor $k=+1,0$, the thermodynamics and the on-shell Euclidean action can either be calculated with the usual counterterm method or through a background subtraction technique. The background subtraction identifies the locally AdS$_ d$ space, i.e., $m=0$, as the reference ground state in which case $r_ {+,k}=0$. However, with $k=-1$, the locally AdS$_ d$ solution contains a bifurcate Killing horizon at $$r_c=\\ell$$ at a fixed temperature. In this case, performing either a background subtraction or utilizing the counterterm method introduces a conical singularities. These singularities are removed when one subtracts an extremal saddle leading to the corrections $\\mathcal{I}_ k^0$.\nThe classical and thermodynamic stability of these solutions have been rigorously explored in here, here, and here. The heat capacity for these solutions is\n$$\\begin{equation} C = \\frac{d\\sigma_{d,k}}{4G_{d+2}}r_+^d\\left(\\frac{(d+1)r_+^2 + (d-1)k\\ell^2}{(d+1)r_+^2 - (d-1) k\\ell^2}\\right). \\end{equation}$$\nWe see that, for non-positive $k$, the heat capacity is always non-negative indicating planar, and hyperbolic black holes are thermodynamically stable. For $k=-1$, the heat capacity vanishes precisely when $r_{+,c} = \\sqrt{(d-1)/(d+1)}\\ell.$\n","date":"3 November 2021","permalink":"/posts/2021-11-03-black-hole-thermodynamics/","section":"Posts","summary":"The conceptually cleanest way to understand the thermodynamics of black holes is by studying the Euclidean path integral for gravity.","title":"Black Hole Thermodynamics in AdS$_ d$"}]
